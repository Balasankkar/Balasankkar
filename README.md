Hi, I’m a cybersecurity learner transitioning from a background in digital marketing into the world of Threat intelligence, incidence response, ethical hacking and information security.

For the past 5–6 months, I’ve been training hands-on through TryHackMe, earning two certificates and solving practical labs covering web exploitation, privilege escalation, and vulnerability assessment.

My earlier experience taught me how to investigate deeply, think critically, and communicate clearly — skills I now apply to cybersecurity research, threat analysis, and pentesting practice. I’m passionate about learning how systems break, how they can be defended, and how to explain complex technical issues in simple, actionable terms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a strong foundation in both **offensive and defensive security**.  
- Document all my **TryHackMe labs, CTF writeups, and mini-projects** here on GitHub.  
- Develop skills in **penetration testing**, **vulnerability research**, and **automation (Python/Bash)**.  
- Contribute to **open-source cybersecurity projects** and collaborative learning communities.  
- Transition into an **entry-level cybersecurity role** where I can apply both technical and investigative strengths.

## 🧠 Current Focus  
- 🧩 Learning advanced **Linux privilege escalation** and **web app exploitation**  
- ⚙️ Improving **Python scripting for automation**  
- 🎯 Completing more **TryHackMe** challenges  
- 🧾 Practicing **report writing** for professional pentesting workflows
