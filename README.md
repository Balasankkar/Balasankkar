[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balasankkararavindhakshan) [![TryHackMe](https://img.shields.io/badge/TryHackMe-212C42?style=for-the-badge&logo=tryhackme&logoColor=white)](https://tryhackme.com/p/Balasankkar) 

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast transitioning from a strong foundation in digital marketing into the security domain. Over the past year, I’ve built practical skills through hands-on learning and recently strengthened my fundamentals by earning the CompTIA Security+ certification.

Security+ helped me develop a solid understanding of :

• Core security concepts such as access control, identity and authentication

• Network security architecture, protocols, and secure configurations

• Risk management, vulnerability management, and governance principles

• Incident response processes, threat categories, and security monitoring workflows

This foundational knowledge prepares me to contribute effectively in real-world security environments — especially in areas like security operations, threat analysis, and incident response.

Hands-on SOC Experience (TryHackMe) :

Alongside Security+, I’ve completed two TryHackMe certificates and dozens of labs, including SOC simulator pathways that replicate real Security Operations Center workflows. These simulations helped me develop skills in :

• Log analysis (SIEM-focused)

• Alert triage and prioritization

• Recognizing malicious patterns in network and host activity

• Documenting and reporting security incidents

• Investigating phishing, malware behavior, and common attack paths

This experience feels close to working in a real SOC environment and has shaped my interest in blue-team work, threat intelligence, and security monitoring.

My strengths :

• Security+ knowledge backed by practical SOC and CTF-style lab work

• Strong investigative mindset and analytical thinking

• Ability to convert complex findings into clear, actionable reports

• Fast learner, adaptable, and comfortable collaborating across teams

• Solid foundation in both offensive and defensive fundamentals

I’m actively exploring opportunities in SOC analysis, threat intelligence, security monitoring, and incident response, where I can apply real-world simulator experience, strong fundamentals, and a passion for continuous learning.

If you’re hiring early-career cybersecurity talent, mentoring aspiring analysts, or collaborating on CTFs/blue-team projects — I’d love to connect.
