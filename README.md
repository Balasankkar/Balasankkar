I'm actively building my cybersecurity skill set through hands-on learning, SOC-style labs, and continuous practice. Over the past year, I’ve strengthened my fundamentals with the CompTIA Security+ certification and applied them through practical exercises on TryHackMe.

## 🔐 What I’ve Been Working On
- Core security principles: access control, identity, authentication  
- Network security, secure configurations & monitoring  
- Risk and vulnerability management  
- Incident response fundamentals and threat analysis  

---

## 🛡️ Hands-On SOC Experience  
Through TryHackMe pathways and SOC simulators, I've gained experience in:
- Log analysis & SIEM workflows  
- Alert triage and escalation  
- Identifying malicious patterns in host/network logs  
- Documenting and reporting incidents  
- Investigating phishing & malware behavior  

These labs helped me understand real SOC operations and shaped my interest in **blue-team security, threat intelligence, and incident response**.

## 💡 Strengths
- Security+ fundamentals applied in practical labs  
- Analytical and investigative mindset  
- Clear communication of complex findings  
- Fast learner with experience collaborating across teams
